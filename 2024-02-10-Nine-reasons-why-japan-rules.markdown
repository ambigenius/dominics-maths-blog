Japanese Counting System: The Japanese counting system is logical and systematic, making it surprisingly accessible for learners. The numbers 1 to 10 have their own unique words, and counting beyond 10 follows a straightforward pattern (e.g., 11 is "ten-one" (十一, juu-ichi), 21 is "two-ten-one" (二十一, ni-juu-ichi)).

Learning Kanji for Numbers: Learning the kanji for numbers is useful, especially for practical purposes like reading prices.

Advantages of the Japanese System: The system's regularity simplifies learning numbers up to 999 with minimal additional vocabulary. For larger numbers, terms for thousand (千, sen), ten thousand (万, man), and beyond are introduced, maintaining the system's consistency.

Mathematical Terminology: Naming polygons in Japanese is straightforward, involving the count of sides plus "kakkei" (角形) for shape (e.g., triangle is "three-shape" (三角形, sankakkei)).

Kuku for Multiplication: The kuku is a mnemonic chant for learning multiplication tables up to 9x9, essential for foundational math skills in Japan.

Soroban (Abacus): The soroban, a traditional Japanese abacus, is a tool still used for teaching arithmetic, promoting fast and accurate mental calculation. Mastery can lead to performing complex calculations quicker than using an electronic calculator.

Mental Arithmetic (Anzan Soroban): Advanced soroban users can perform calculations mentally (anzan soroban), visualizing the abacus in their mind to solve problems without the physical tool.

Flash Anzan: A competitive exercise where participants quickly add multiple numbers flashed briefly on a screen, demonstrating the impressive calculation speed some achieve through practice.

Cultural Attitude Towards Math: Mathematics in Japan is approached with a positive attitude, seen as both a subject to master and a playful intellectual pursuit. This contrasts with perceptions in some other cultures, contributing to higher confidence and enjoyment in learning math among Japanese students.
