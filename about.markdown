About the Ambigenius

Welcome to the fantastical world of the Ambigenius Learning Rainbow, a place where the colors of math and life blend into a spectacle of learning and laughter. Our maestro of this merry and mathematical domain is none other than myself, a 33-year-old erstwhile globe-trotter turned math enthusiast, who, after a grand tour lasting fifteen years, decided that the greatest adventure lies in the realms of algebra and algorithms and slightly dodgy self referential blog authorship.

Hailing from the serene lands of Havelock North, where the numbers first whispered to them, the eponymous A embarked on a journey not just across the globe but through the vast landscapes of knowledge. With a heart longing for stability yet feet that couldn't resist the call of the horizon, A lived a life that seems more like a series of unexpected chapters in a book written by a particularly mischievous author.

You see, they developed a rather peculiar relationship with travel. Imagine a bird that loves the sky but dreams of walking; that's me with traveling. Fifteen years of it, and A has come to the astonishing realization that the most thrilling journey is the one inward and upward – into the mind and through the cosmos of calculus and beyond.

As for my intellectual appetites, let's just say they feast on knowledge like a connoisseur of fine dining. There's a peculiar joy in knowing a little more than necessary about everything under the sun – and then some. It's not just about being 'smart'; it's about finding those nuggets of wisdom that spark laughter, the kind that echoes through the halls of your own mind, keeping the dreariness of boredom at bay.

Ah, and then there's the music. Give me an instrument, and they´ll make it sing, dance, and perhaps weave a spell or two – a bard of sorts in a digital age. It's not just playing; it's conversing with the soul, a dialogue that can be quite enchanting, and even pathetic.

Languages, you ask? Oui, sí, and a bit of pidgin to spice things up. A polyglot's life is a rich tapestry, each language a thread that adds depth and color, allowing the A to whisper sweet nothings in the ears of mathematics in its own native tongues.

Now, as A stands on the precipice of a new adventure – diving back into the world of mathematics with an eye on the prize: a degree in Software Engineering from Massey University – they can't help but chuckle at the irony. They may say: ¨Here I am, seeking the stability I once thought boring, in the most unstable and unpredictable of disciplines...¨

So, dear reader, as you join our author on this journey through the Learning Rainbow, expect tales of mathematical conquests, life lessons learned (and unlearned), and perhaps, just perhaps, the occasional serenade. Welcome to the world of the Ambigenius – it's going to be a whimsically wild ride.
